# Force Atlas 2 graph layout in networkx

## Purposes

Implementation of the Force Atlas 2 graph layout algorithm in `python` using `networkx`. The FA2 is used in *Gephy*, and is really good to visualize clusters and node centrality/hubness.

## Requirements

`python` (duh)

`numpy`, `scipy`, `networkx` (tested with 1.8.dev, probably working with 1.7 as well)
